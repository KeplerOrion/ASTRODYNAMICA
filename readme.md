# ASTRODYNAMICA
![ASTRODYNAMICA_LOGO_1](assets\images\ASTRODYNAMICA_LOGO.png)
Astrodynamica is a lightweight software tool that utilizes **Orekit** and **CesiumJS** to visualize orbital mechanics data in a web-based 3D environment.

## Features
- Accepts **Two-Line Element (TLE)** sets, **Keplerian elements**, and **Geodetic entity definitions** as input.
- Generates **CZML** (Cesium Language) files for dynamic visualization.
- Populates a **CesiumJS Viewer** with entities based on provided orbital data.  

## Architecture
- **Orekit Side**  
  - Powered by [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/) via **orekit-jpype**  
  - Runs a basic **Flask service/API** to accept & process orbital parameters, sensor definitions, and geodetic-static coordinates into actionable data in the form of event logs (via orekit's event handlers), state vectors, & temporal data.  

- **CesiumJS Side**  
  - Consumes calculations, CZML files, and insights generated by the Orekit service.
  - Renders satellites and orbital paths in an interactive 3D globe
  - Populates ground stations & geodetic points per their definitions

## Getting Started
1. Provide orbital parameters (TLEs, Keplerian elements), ground station definitions, or geodetic coordinates.
2. Select propagation handlers for desired calculations, insights, experimentation, or curiosities
3. Run the analysis! Optionally, instantiate a CesiumJS viewer for deeper insights or visual confirmation.

## Purpose 
Astrodynamica is designed as a simple foundation for multi-domain visualization & analysis workflows. This software is really meant to be a starting point for other teams, or maybe just a bit of inspiration for your own projects! 

I'm a huge fan of what the Cesium and Orekit teams have achieved and continued to achieve, and wanted to spread the knowledge of how to use these tools to others. I hope this can be of some academic utility to you. 

## Contributing
If you encounter any bugs or have feedback to provide, please open an Issue describing the problem, the behavior you expected, and the steps to reproduce. 

If you've developed your own fix or an improvement, and would like to share, please feel free to:
1. Fork this repository
2. Create your own feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Open a Pull Request explaining your changes and reasoning.

For any major changes, please open an Issue first to encourage discussion prior to making a PR. Of course, you can always keep your fixes to yourself! I am just happy to help.

## Examples
Forthcoming. Scope creep got the better of me for now, so I’m focusing on cleaning up the infrastructure before the first release. My goal is to have most features ready before the end of the year!
